### [Course Contents](https://moodle.jku.at/jku/course/view.php?id=11676#section-0)

This course provides a very first look at Artificial Intelligence as a research area. Its focus is primarily on


* **History**: AI is an area that already has a long tradition. We want to cover its development and essential achievements
* **Problems**: What are the problems that AI has to face? Why are they hard?
* **Applications**: What are potential applications for AI techniques? What applications already use AI?  


We do *not* cover state-of-the-art techniques in depth, they will be covered in later courses (e.g., 3rd semester AI course).
