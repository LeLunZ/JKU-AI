### [Communication](https://moodle.jku.at/jku/course/view.php?id=11676#section-1)

Because of the ongoing Covid-19 Pandemic, many of the traditional means of communication cannot be used or only be used to a limited extend. We therefore have to try to replace them with digital alternatives.  

* **Classroom participation:** is unfortunately limited to only 50 students. We will establish a round robin system, where students can participate on site as often as possible, and all students will have an equal chance of being on site. Conversely, nobody is required to participate on site - the course can also be attended entirely on-line.  

* **Zoom sessions:** Lectures will be streamed live and students can attend on-line
* **Lecture recordings:** All zoom sessions will be recorded and be made available to the students.
* **Lecture slides:** All Lecture slides are available on-line. Note, however, that the version that is available before the lecture is the version from last year. They might be replaced with ***updates after the lecture*****.**  

* **Discussion forum:** You can use the discussion forum for getting in touch with each other and with the instructor.

You can use it to discuss all matters related to this course, find learning partners, pose and discuss questions, etc. The instructors will regularly scan the forum for questions they can answer, but this is primarily meant to be for discussions among students.
