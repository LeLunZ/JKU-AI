### [Python Crash Course](https://moodle.jku.at/jku/course/view.php?id=11569#section-4)

The exercise assignments will be based on **Python**. If you are not familiar with it, don't despair: it's very easy to learn (and very useful to know!). For your convenience, we are providing here two notebooks for self-study, but you may also use any other resource on the web, or just try to dive in directly into the exercise.
