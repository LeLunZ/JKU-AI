 #### Goal

 The exercises accompany the lecture "Artificial Intelligence" by Prof. Widmer, putting many of the discussed concepts and methods into practice. By the end of the term, you will be familiar both with a range of intelligent search methods and with unicorns.

 #### Mode

 There are five physical exercise groups in Linz, one physical group in Vienna, and one fully virtual group. All share this Moodle course. Due to the current regulations, physical exercise groups cannot be attended by all registered participants at once. We will therefore hold the exercises in **Hybrid mode**: For each exercise set, we will record and upload videos explaining the solutions to anybody interested. In addition, we will have physical meetings to explain our solutions, discuss your own solutions, and answer questions – these are available only to a limited number of participants, require registration, and will not be recorded.
