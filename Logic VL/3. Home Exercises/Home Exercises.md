### [Home Exercises](https://moodle.jku.at/jku/course/view.php?id=10258#section-2)

Every week you find here some exercises for practice at home (the solutions don't have to be turned in). Solutions will be presented by the lecturers in a live stream (10:45-11:45), but ideally you prepare it in advance. Questions are very much welcome in the live session.
