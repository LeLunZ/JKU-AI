### [Self-Learning Support for SAT](https://moodle.jku.at/jku/course/view.php?id=10258#section-6)


* The quizzes below provide a selection of questions regarding the lecture on SAT.  


The catalog of questions is by far not exhaustive. They are not intended to be learned by heart, but they should be only considered as additional support for the test preparation and trigger discussion among you and your peer students.

If you have feedback or questions or a bug report, please post them in the Moodle Forum or write an email to martina.seidl@jku.at.

Note that the size of a quiz does not correspond to the size of a minitest. Doing a quiz is on a voluntary basis and does not have any influence on the grade. There are also tasks which you have to solve on paper. Then you have to compare solutions when you are done with the quiz. In the minitests there will be no tasks in which you have to upload a picture/file.  


  


To see reference solutions, you have to press the submit button.
