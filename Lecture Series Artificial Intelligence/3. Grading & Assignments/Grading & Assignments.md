### [Grading / Assignments](https://moodle.jku.at/jku/course/view.php?id=10807#section-2)


* 
	+ For each talk there will be an online assignment in Moodle.
	+ You have two weeks time to hand in a plain text file (.txt) with 200 to 400 words length
	+ File name format: "yourstudentid\_numberoflecture.txt", e.g. k09860565\_3.txt for lecture 3
	+ The file has to contain the following (in English):
	1. First half: Summary with main message of the talk in view of your personal background and interests in AI  
	
	2. Second half: Answer the following questions: Was the talk well suited for the target audience (1st semester Bachelor students)? What did you personally find most interesting and what did you specifically learn? What was less understandable or what would you have liked to hear more about? How did you like the topic and the style of the presentation? And anything else you would like to add.
	+ Grading of all reports will take place at the end of the semester. Do not expect marks/feedback on your reports during the semester.
	+ Grading will depend on the quality and the number of your reports, not your personal opinions.
	+ If there are n assignments during the semster, you need to hand in at least n-1 reports for grade 1 ("Sehr Gut"), and at least n/2 reports for grade 4 ("Gen√ºgend"). If you hand in less than n/2 reports, you will get no certificate (and not a negative certificate).  
	
	+ Your summary/feedback may be forwarded to the speaker in an anonymized way.
