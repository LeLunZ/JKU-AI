		 - Computer Go -- From the Beginnings to AlphaGo and Beyond + Abstract:
	 
		 - The ancient game of Go has long been used as a test bed for measuring progress in Artificial Intelligence. Decades of work in heuristic search and machine learning culminated in DeepMind's famous AlphaGo programs, which convincingly defeated the world’s strongest human Go players in 2016 and 2017. Current Go programs have greatly surpassed the level of all human experts. In this lecture we introduce the main ideas and technologies behind these programs, following their historical development. In the final part of the talk, we will discuss recent and ongoing work which aims to generalize such approaches to problems that are less well-defined.
