### [Registration for Physical Attendance](https://moodle.jku.at/jku/course/view.php?id=12055#section-1)

Please sign up here if you plan to attend the next lecture in person, in Linz (HS 1) or Vienna (Strozzigasse 2, Room 211), by clicking on the link with the appropriate lecture date, and selecting ***Register for Linz*** or ***Register for Vienna*** as your answer.  
**Note**: you will have to sign up ***every week*** for the next lecture, because we need up-to-date contact lists for each lecture. The link to the registration page for each lecture will appear here on the Wednesday before the next lecture, at 08:30 o'clock. The registration will automatically close when the limit of 115 seats in Linz and 19 in Vienna is reached, and the page will definitely close one hour before the start of the class.
