### [Live Streams](https://moodle.jku.at/jku/course/view.php?id=10809#section-5)


* 
	+ A link to a Zoom live stream will appear here before each lecture.
	+ I cannot follow the Zoom chat during the lecture, but I very much welcome questions from the online audience. Therefore, I would like to ask students in the lecture hall to follow the live chat and ask questions from the chat which they find relevant.
